        <section id="cons">
        <h3><b><u>Cons:</u></b></h3>
            <p>Depending on state to state legal charges may differ. For this excercise we will take a look at an incident in New Bedford, Massachusetts
            where a student hit his teacher who was older than 60 with a chair for taking away his phone.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Kemar Omar Roselus, 18, of New Bedford, allegedly threw a chair at his teacher, Joanne Moura, after she confiscated his phone. He has been charged with assault by means of a dangerous weapon on a person over 60, disturbing the school, and malicious destruction of personal property, officials say. He was also expelled from school.</p>
            
            <p>In Massachusetts, under MGL c. 265 s. 15A, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon is a felony which carries up to 10 years in state prison and $5,000 fine.</p>

                <li>10 Years in prison</li>
                <li>$5,000 Fine</li>

                        <li>Congrats, you just wiped out 1/3 of the human population</li>
