			<h3>Intro</h3>
            
            
			<p>
				My name is Rob Morvillo, born and raised in Staten Island New York since February 28th, 1997.
                I am an avid skiier and Videogame aficionado who enjoys exploring the Pennsylvania forest on 
                foot or by quad, fishing, kayaking, or riding equestrians every so often. Just as easily I love 
                spending time inside with a keyboard and mouse Earning "chicken dinners" in <b>Player Unknowns 
                BattleGrounds</b> or using superior planning and <i>team communication</i> to destroy other teams 
                on <b>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</b>. My favorite movie of all time is easily Christopher Nolan's 
                <b>Interstellar</b> a modern classic that forces the viewer to actually pay attention and stay off of 
                their phone and give the silver screen their undivided attention.

			<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
			<p class="special">
				For the Fall 2017 semester I had the opportunity to study abroad in Siena, Italy. There I took trips 
                throughout Italy to cities like Rome, Florence, and Capri. I had also had the opportunity to take a weekend 
                trip to Oktoberfest in Munchen, Germany. Above is a picture of myself taken infront of the Coloseum in Rome,
                one of the 7 wonders of the world.

		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>
			My purpose in this world is to do all that I can, and do it to the best of my ability. Spending countless hours volunteeing especially
            in places far from home will help give yourself an understanding of what it's like to live in other people's shoes.
            With Habitat for Humanity, here in Albany and North Carolina I have learned of struggles lower class families have 
            suffered from, endured, and risen from. Abroad in Italy I have learned how hard it is for the immigrant
            populations and refugees settle in a land so foreign not understanding the language as well. I have myself in a way experienced the 
            same thing because of the lack of speaking Italian. After time it got better but I always stuck out when trying to converse with local Italians.
            It is the responsibility of each and ever one of us to help one another as much as we can.
